# Data Pipeline Microservices API Demo
**This project is a demonstration of a RESTful API for handling fitness tracking data from wearable devices. It is designed to showcase the use of microservices architecture with Java and Spring technologies, including Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, RabbitMQ, and MySQL.**
- Please note that the fitness tracking data used in this project is intended for demonstration purposes only, and is fabricated for simulation purposes. The primary focus of this project is to showcase the use of microservices, RESTful APIs, and a data pipeline architecture.

## Features
- RESTful APIs for publishing and processing fitness tracking data
- Microservices pipeline for data ingestion, simulation, and processing
- High availability and flexibility with Spring Cloud Eureka Server Cluster for microservices registration and discovery
- Use of RabbitMQ for decoupling data buffer and data broker
- Secure syncing and archiving of data to a MySQL database using Data Processor Microservice

## Requirements
- Java 11 or later
- Spring Boot 2.5.x
- RabbitMQ 3.8.x
- MySQL
